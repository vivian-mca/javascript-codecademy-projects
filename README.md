# Codecademy Projects* | JavaScript

These are JavaScript projects* I have created in Codecademy, primarily under the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

Each project has a **README.md** file and is listed under the course it was created in.

###### *Currently, the projects mainly consist of code snippets.
