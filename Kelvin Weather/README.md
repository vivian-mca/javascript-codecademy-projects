## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Introduction** Module. It was created to build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing initializing variables and printing to the console.


### Project Goals

**Context:** Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

### Tasks

1. Create a constant variable, `kelvin`.
2. Create an equation to convert Kelvin to Celsius and store it as `celsius`.
3. Create an equation to calculate Farenheit and store it as `fahrenheit`.
4. Round the number saved to `fahrenheit`.
5. Print the temperature in `fahrenheit` to the console.
6. Write comments explaining the lines of code.
7. BONUS: Convert `celsius` to the Newton scale and save it to `newton`.

## My process

### Built with

- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me to understand the concept of variables and how to use them in JavaScript. I learned how to use the `console.log` function to print to the console. I also learned how to use the `Math.floor` function to round down the number saved to `fahrenheit`.

## Useful resources 

- [MDN Web Docs |  Math.floor()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) - Documentation for the `Math.floor` function.
- [Wikipedia | Newton scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_scale) - Wikipedia page for the Newton scale containing the equation for converting Celsius to Newton.
