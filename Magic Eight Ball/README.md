## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Conditinals** Module. It was created to build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing control flow by using conditional statements.

### Project Goals

Build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript. The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.


### Tasks

1. Create a variable named `userName` that the user can leave empty or set to their name.
2. Create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not.
3. Create a variable named `userQuestion`. The value of the variable should be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball.
4. Write a `console.log()` statement for the `userQuestion`, stating what was asked.
5. Create a variable named `randomNumber` that generates a number between 0 and 7.
6. Create a variable named `eightBall` that takes in the value of `randomNumber` and assigns one of the eight possible Magic Eight Ball phrases as its reply.
7. Print the Magic Eight Ball's reply to the console.

## My process

### Built with

- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me practice utilizing conditional projects. For this project, I -
- used `switch` statements instead of `if/else` statements,
- learned to utilize `ternary` expressions, and
- created a random number generator using `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` methods.
